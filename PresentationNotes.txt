[Create a tournament before the presentation with a deadline that has passed to show that it cannot be edited. make sure the matches are set up]

Our Tournament Manager program allows users to create, edit, and schedule tournaments. You are able to create, edit, and remove teams and players, as well as delete tournaments.

[OPEN PROGRAM]

This is the starting point of our program. From here, you can either choose 'Create Tournament' to create a new tournament, or 'Check Tournaments' to view the existing list of tournaments. First, lets look at the existing tournaments.

[CLICK CHECK TOURNAMENTS (to show that we can save tournaments)]

We see that there is currently one tournament saved. Now lets go back and create a new tournament.

[CLICK BACK]

[CLICK CREATE TOURNAMENT]

From this menu you can enter all relevant information about a tournament including the name and location of the tournament, the deadline, the max number of allowable teams, as well as the format of the tournament.

[FILL OUT ALL BUT ONE FIELD. DEADLINE SHOULD NOT BE PASSED. MAX TEAMS AT LEAST 5]

If there is a field that is not filled out, the user will get a warning.

[PRESS SUBMIT (one field still blank, to show warning)]

[FINISH FILLING OUT FIELDS AND SUBMIT]

Now that we have created the tournament, we can view and edit it from the list of tournaments.

[CLICK CHECK TOURNAMENTS]

You can see that the tournament we create is now on the list. lets go ahead and edit it.

[CLICK EDIT TOURNAMENT]

From this menu, you have the ability to add and edit teams. Since this is a new tournament, there are currently no teams so lets add some.

[CLICK ADD TEAM]

Again, if the field is blank the user gets a warning

[CLICK SUBMIT (name blank)]

[CREATE 5 TEAMS]

Now that we have some teams created, we can select them from the drop-down menu.

[CLICK DROP-DOWN, SELECT A TEAM]

Once a team is selected, the edit team button can be pressed to edit the team details.

[CLICK EDIT TEAM]

From here, we can change the name of the team, as well as add players to the team.

[CHANGE NAME OF TEAM]

[CLICK ADD PLAYER]

[FILL OUT ALL FIELDS EXCEPT ONE]

Here we fill out all the player information. Again, if a field is left blank the user gets a warning.

[PRESS SUBMIT (one field still blank to show warning)]

[FINISH FILLING OUT FIELDS AND SUBMIT]

Once we submit, we are taken back to the team menu where we can view and edit the list of players. If you want to edit the player details, we click edit player

[CLICK EDIT PLAYER]

[CHANGE AT LEAST ONE FIELD AND SUBMIT]

Once we submit the update, it is save.

[CLICK EDIT AGAIN (to show the update was saved)]

If a player is no longer on the team, they can simple be deleted.

[CLICK DELETE PLAYER]

[CLICK SUBMIT/BACK]

if a team is no longer in the tournament, it can also be deleted.

[SELECT A TEAM, PRESS EDIT TEAM, PRESS DELETE]

now the team is no longer on the list of teams

[OPEN DROP-DOWN MENU (to show the team is gone)]

[CLICK BACK] 

Once the deadline of a tournament has passed, a schedule will be created for the team. If the deadline has not passed, the view schedule button is disable. {the final iteration will have a warning to tell the user this}

[CLICK VIEW SCHEDULE OF THE TOURNAMENT WE CREATED]

Note that the first tournament on the list's deadline has already passed. The user is no longer able to edit the tournament, but can now view the schedule for the games {the final iteration will have the list of matches displayed, {as well as the time and the score of the tournaments}}

[CLICK BACK]

Finally, the user has the ability to delete a tournament.

[CLICK EDIT TOURNAMENT (second tournament, the one we just created)]

[CLICK DELETE]
